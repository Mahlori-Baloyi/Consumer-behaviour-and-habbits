FINDINGS

1. Demographics and Customer Distribution:

The customer base is evenly distributed across various age groups, with a significant proportion falling in the 50 to 60 years old range. However, the data shows a skew towards more male customers. To capitalize on this diverse demographic, targeted marketing strategies should be employed to appeal to both genders.

2. Product Preferences and Seasonal Trends:

Clothes emerge as the most popular category, with specific items like jewelry, blouse, and pants leading in sales. Notably, seasonal variations impact product performance, indicating a need for adaptive inventory management and targeted seasonal marketing campaigns.

3. Purchase Behavior and Subscription Impact:

Insights reveal that average purchase amounts remain consistent whether customers apply discounts or not. A tenuous positive correlation exists, though it is not statistically significant. Subscribed customers make more frequent purchases, and non-subscribers tend to spend more per transaction. Strategies should focus on enhancing loyalty programs and encouraging subscription sign-ups.

4. Geographical Variances:

While Montana records the highest number of purchases, preferences vary by location. For instance, skirts are most popular in Minnesota. To leverage regional preferences, customize marketing campaigns to suit the unique demands of each location.

5. Payment Methods and Shipping Preferences:

PayPal emerges as the most used payment method, especially among customers aged 50-59. Gender-specific payment preferences highlight the need for tailored checkout experiences. Free shipping is the most preferred option, and shipping methods significantly impact customer satisfaction and average payment amounts.

6. Promo Code Usage and Product Category Preferences:

Promo codes exhibit seasonal trends, with higher usage in spring and lower in fall. Tailor promo code offerings to align with seasonal patterns. Certain product categories such as clothes, accessories, footwear, and outerwear consistently perform well across seasons, providing opportunities for targeted marketing and promotions.
